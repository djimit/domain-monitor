# Domain Monitor - Strategic Feature Analysis & Recommendations

**Analysis Date:** October 21, 2025
**Analyst:** Strategic Product Planning
**Scope:** Brand Protection & Online Identity Security

---

## Executive Summary

The domain security landscape is shifting from **reactive detection** to **predictive prevention**. Businesses need:
1. **Proactive threat prediction** before attacks occur
2. **Multi-channel monitoring** beyond just domains
3. **Automated response** capabilities for rapid mitigation
4. **Business intelligence** that quantifies risk in financial terms
5. **Compliance integration** for regulatory requirements

**Key Insight:** Organizations lose an average of $4.2M per successful phishing attack (IBM 2024). Prevention is 100x more cost-effective than remediation.
