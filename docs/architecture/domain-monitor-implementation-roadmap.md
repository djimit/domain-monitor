## 3. Technical Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 Microservices Implementation Approach

The microservices architecture will be implemented using a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach:

1. **Start with Core Services**: Begin with monolithic-like services that gradually split as boundaries become clearer
2. **Identify Bounded Contexts**: Refine service boundaries based on domain contexts
3. **Evolution over Big-Bang**: Allow microservices to evolve rather than attempting to design the perfect architecture upfront
4. **Service Interaction Patterns**: Use both synchronous (REST/gRPC) and asynchronous (event-driven) patterns as appropriate

#### Initial Service Decomposition:

| Early Phase Services | Later Phase Decomposition |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Authentication Service | Remains standalone |
| Domain Management Service | Splits into Domain Service and Variant Generation Service |
| Scanning Service | Splits into specialized scanning services (WHOIS, DNS, SSL, Content, Blacklist) |
| Reporting Service | Remains standalone but with enhanced capabilities |

### 3.2 Database Implementation

#### Data Storage Approach:

1. **Start with PostgreSQL**: Begin with a well-structured relational database for the core data model
2. **Introduce MongoDB**: Add as scan results grow in volume and complexity
3. **Elasticsearch Integration**: Implement for advanced search and analytics in later phases
4. **Redis Caching**: Implement early for performance optimization

#### Migration Strategy:

- Use database migration tools (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase) from the beginning
- Implement data versioning for NoSQL documents
- Create data access layers that abstract storage details from services

### 3.3 API Implementation

#### API Development Approach:

1. **API-First Design**: Define API contracts before implementation
2. **OpenAPI Specification**: Use OpenAPI for documentation and code generation
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Implement standard patterns for pagination, filtering, and error handling
4. **Versioning from Start**: Implement API versioning from the beginning

### 3.4 Frontend Implementation

#### UI Development Strategy:

1. **Component Library**: Develop a reusable component library early
2. **Design System**: Establish a consistent design system
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with essential UI and progressively add features
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile-friendly design from the start

### 3.5 Security Implementation

#### Security Approach:

1. **Security Requirements**: Define security requirements for each phase
2. **Shift-Left Security**: Integrate security practices throughout the SDLC
3. **Regular Testing**: Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing
4. **Security Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring from early phases

## 4. Technical Debt Management

To manage technical debt effectively throughout the implementation:

1. **Deliberate Technical Debt Decisions**:
   - Document when and why technical debt is incurred
   - Set explicit timelines for addressing known debt
   - Balance quick delivery with long-term sustainability

2. **Technical Debt Tracking**:
   - Maintain a technical debt registry
   - Assign "interest rates" to prioritize debt items
   - Allocate 20% of each sprint to debt reduction

3. **Refactoring Strategy**:
   - Plan deliberate refactoring phases
   - Use feature toggles to safely deploy large refactorings
   - Maintain high test coverage to enable safe refactoring

4. **Code Quality Gates**:
   - Establish automated quality metrics
   - Set minimum thresholds for test coverage
   - Use static analysis tools to prevent new issues

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Test Levels

| Test Level | Implementation Phase | Description |
|------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Unit Tests | From beginning | Test individual components in isolation |

| API Tests | From beginning | Verify API contracts and behaviors |
| UI Tests | MVP phase | Test user interface functionality |
| Performance Tests | Enhancement phase | Verify system performance under load |
| Security Tests | All phases | Verify security controls and identify vulnerabilities |

### 5.2 Test Automation

1. **Continuous Testing**:
   - Automate tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
   - Run fast tests on every commit, comprehensive tests before deployment
   - Generate test reports and quality metrics

2. **Test Data Management**:
