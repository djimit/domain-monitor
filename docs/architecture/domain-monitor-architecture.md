# Domain-Monitor System Architecture

## 1. System Overview

The Domain-Monitor is an enterprise-grade security application designed to detect and analyze domain-based threats such as typosquatting, cybersquatting, and malicious domains. The application follows a microservices architecture with event-driven patterns, designed for cloud-native deployment with high availability, fault tolerance, and scalable performance.

## 2. Architectural Principles

- **Microservices Architecture**: Decompose the application into independently deployable, loosely-coupled services
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Use asynchronous messaging for service decoupling and workflow orchestration
- **Cloud-Native Design**: Leverage containerization, orchestration, and managed services
- **Defense in Depth**: Implement security at every layer of the application
- **Privacy by Design**: Ensure GDPR compliance and data protection measures
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Allow individual components to scale based on demand
- **Resilience**: Design for fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- **Observability**: Enable comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing

## 9. Scalability and Performance Considerations

### 9.1 Horizontal Scalability

- All services are designed to be stateless where possible
- Services scale independently based on load
- Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscalers adjust replica count based on CPU/memory usage or custom metrics

  - API response caching
  - Distributed caching for sharing data between services
  - Cache invalidation policies to maintain data freshness

- **Asynchronous Processing**:
  - Long-running scans processed asynchronously
  - Non-blocking operations for improved throughput

- **Data Tiering**:
  - Hot data in high-performance storage
  - Infrequently accessed data in cold storage
  - Archival policies for historical scan data

- **Resource Optimization**:
  - Resource limits and requests for all containers
  - Efficient database query design
  - Optimized API calls to external services

## 10. Future Considerations

### 10.1 Machine Learning Integration
