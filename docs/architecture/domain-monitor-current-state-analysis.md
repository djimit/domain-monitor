```

#### 2. Solid Technical Foundation
- **Modern Technology Stack**: React, TypeScript, Node.js
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices with event-driven communication
- **Security-First Design**: RBAC, encryption, audit logging
- **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes, containerization, managed services

#### 3. Domain Expertise Integration
- **Comprehensive Threat Coverage**: 8+ typosquatting algorithms
- **Industry Best Practices**: OWASP, NIST compliance
- **Enterprise Requirements**: GDPR, audit trails, integration capabilities

### Current Gaps

#### 1. Implementation vs. Architecture Mismatch
```typescript
// Current: Monolithic Service
const app = express();
app.post('/api/v1/domains/variants/generate', handler);

// Target: Microservices Architecture
const services = {
  domainVariantService: 'http://domain-variant-service:3000',
  scanOrchestrationService: 'http://scan-orchestration:3001',
  riskScoringService: 'http://risk-scoring:3002'
};
```

#### 2. Missing Core Infrastructure
- No database implementation
- No authentication system
- No message broker for event-driven architecture
- No API gateway for service coordination

#### 3. Limited Scanning Capabilities
```typescript
// Current: Basic DNS + HTTP
const basicScan = {
  dnsResolved: boolean,
  httpStatus: number | null
};

// Target: Comprehensive Analysis
const comprehensiveScan = {
  whois: WHOISRecord,
  dns: DNSRecord[],
  ssl: SSLCertificate,
  content: ContentScan,
  blacklists: BlacklistCheck[],
  riskScore: number
};
```

## Technical Debt Analysis

### High Priority Issues

#### 1. Architecture Alignment
- **Issue**: Current implementation is monolithic, not microservices
- **Impact**: Scalability limitations, deployment complexity
- **Recommendation**: Gradual decomposition starting with domain boundaries

#### 2. Data Persistence
- **Issue**: In-memory storage only
- **Impact**: Data loss, no historical analysis
- **Recommendation**: Implement PostgreSQL + MongoDB hybrid approach

#### 3. Security Implementation
- **Issue**: No authentication or authorization
- **Impact**: Security vulnerability, compliance risk
- **Recommendation**: Implement JWT-based auth with RBAC

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 1. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Basic error handling in services
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, debugging difficulties
- **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive error handling strategy

#### 2. Testing Coverage
- **Issue**: Limited test coverage (only variant generation)
- **Impact**: Quality risks, regression potential
- **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive testing strategy
